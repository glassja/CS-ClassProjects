Vision


Introduction:
        
        We envision a wearable activity tracking watch that provides more than just the current moment’s data. We envision a Fitbit that shows the user graphs of their activity over the past 5 days. Furthermore, the Fitbit will be integrated with a web/mobile app that will feature more robust analysis and tracking. We envision the Fitbit Pentic.


Positioning


        Business Opportunity:
This newest Fitbit adds the ability to visualize data collected over a timespan of up to five days instead of just an hour or a single day. In addition, since all Fitbits sync to the general Fitbit platform, the market size is already well established and growing. Fitbit can also sync to other third-party apps and platforms which further increases the size of the market.


        Problem Statement:
Current Fitbits and related devices are great for ‘in the moment’ tracking of a user’s activity, but generally do not provide the ability to visualize data beyond an hour or a day. This forces the user to constantly sync their device(s) to a mobile/web app which places a significant drain on both the device’s and, in the case of a mobile app, the phone’s battery. Furthermore, the lack of ability to quickly and easily visualize activity makes it difficult for the user to see trends and patterns in their activity.


        Product Position Statement:
This device is for anyone that wants to track and visualize their daily activity. This goes beyond the current Fitbits available by including visualization of five days of activity data. This expanded time frame allows the user to see and utilize trends and patterns in their day to day activity.

This will empower them to take even greater control over their health by giving them new tools to assess themselves with. They’ll be able to see anomalies in their patterns and determine if they were due to behavioral changes or something else.


        Key High-Level Goals and Problems of the Stakeholders:
        
High-Level Goal
	Priority
	Problems and Concerns
	Current Solutions
	Continuous activity and health tracking
	High
	* Battery life
* Consistent data collection, minimize holes and gaps
* Minimize memory footprint of the data


	Existing products provide good activity tracking capability but the data may be oversized and under optimized. Additionally, battery life can be improved.
	Storage of 5 days of data
	High
	* Limited memory space
* Data needs to be secure
* Data needs to be quickly accessible
	Current products reduce the amount of data that can be stored and accessed on the devices instead of increasing their internal memory. Current devices are relatively secure and security support by the Fitbit platform is adequate.
	Intuitive UI
	High
	* More features means more screens to navigate through
* The screens must be well organized and easy to navigate
* The touch/button interface must be intuitive and natural to use.
	Current products have well designed UIs that can be used as a model. The addition of a few more screens should not negatively impact the user experience.
	

User-Level Goals:


* User: track and monitor activity and health data, visualize patterns and trends in the data.
* HR Sensor: sends HR data to Data System through Processor
* Accelerometer: sends step count data to Data System through Processor
* Data System: obtain data from HR sensor and accelerometer, process data for analysis
* Display: display appropriate screen based on Wearer input, sleep, wake when prompted
* Processor: streamlines and regulates data transactions, processes analysis of data, sends sleep and wake signals, processes Wearer inputs, sends correct screen information to Display.


User Environment:
                Anywhere.


Product Overview


        Product Perspective:
The Fitbit Pentic is a wearable health and activity tracking watch. It is designed to be worn on the wrist as continuously as possible. It will work anywhere and everywhere as it does not require any sort of active Wi-fi or Bluetooth signal to collect data. The Pentic collects and calculates HR, daily step count, calories burned, and weight data. As the data points are collected they are aggregated into graphs that show the user the data trends for each category. The data displays include the current moment’s/day’s data, the past hour of heart rate data, the previous day’s data for all fields, and the previous five days’ data for all fields. In addition, the Pentic can keep track of a daily step count goal that can be set by the user.


Summary of Benefits:

Risk List 


Schedule Risk:
Time Constraints:
        The limited amount of time available in the semester creates problems for
 developers when estimating development time. 


Possible solution: Start early, stick to a schedule and be mindful of deadlines.
        


Technical Risk:


        Lacking Actual Hardware: relying on theory alone.
        Because the actual hardware of the device is not available a lot of the input data will be simulated.                  




Compromise Design: sacrificing design due to limitations.
        Limiting features due to limitations based on time or technology.


        Possible Solution: Be realistic when designing features.


Business Risk:


        Market Saturation: current market has established brands with reliable devices.


                Possible Solution: Incorporate unique features that differentiate the product from the rest.

Glossary


UI (User Interface): Component of the fitness device’s software that will display data collected to the user.


Touch Interface: High-level component of the UI that allows the user to interact through touch- i.e., a tap on the screen or swipe of the finger. 


Initial Values: Values input by the User during setup to provide age, height, weight, and step goal for the device to use when calculating Calories burned, distance walked, steps remaining, and a baseline value for weight.


HR (Heart Rate): Measured in bpm (beats per minute), this measurement can be used by the fitness tracker to garner a more accurate assessment of physical activity, which in turn will lead to a closer estimate of calories burned. Distinguish between resting and active.


Deep Sleep: an ultra low power state for the device where all sensors and UI elements are shut off and only the bare minimum of necessary functions continue running in the background. The state the device is delivered in originally and the state the device enters when the battery dies.


Sleep: a low power state for the fitness device that allows for optimal power usage. Necessary sensors remain active while the display and UI elements are temporarily disabled.


Wake: a high power state in which the UI displays to the user.


Calorie: A unit (kilocalorie) that describes the energy contents of food and drink ingested by the user. Ideally, the user tracks and submits this data. Tracking caloric intake in tandem with recording an accurate measurement of physical activity through the fitness device will lead to an ideal fitness scenario.


Steps:  Depending upon the user’s weight, height, and stride length each step can be converted into calories burned. Primary method of estimating physical activity.


Activity Data: All measurements recorded by the device- i.e., HR, steps, calculated calorie estimation.


Graph: In line or bar form to display activity data collected over a five day period.


Step Goal: The number of steps the User is trying to log each day with the device.


Fitness Profile: The culmination of the activity data, fitness goals, and progress report of the user.


Accelerometer: A device used to measure acceleration forces and movement data


Memory Footprint: The amount of memory the software uses while running.
